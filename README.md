What is this?
=============

This is my experiment in creating a node.js server that would poll pull requests
on github and trigger builds in Jenkins. It will expose its inner state via
web interface. My eventual aim is to replace Jenkins pull request builder plugin. 
I might not ever get there and just have some fun hacking this, we'll see ;-).
